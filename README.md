## About

Over 400 million people all over the world lack access to basic healthcare services. The reality for people living in rural areas for most of the developing world is that there is no doctor nearby. As a result, they have to travel long distances and spend considerable time and money in order to get to the nearest clinic. With the increasing availability of mobile networks and mobile internet even in rural areas we now have new opportunities to provide healthcare.


SwiftSense consumes open source telemedicine platform (Intelehealth) that empowers local community health workers (CHWs) in rural communities to facilitate tele-consultations with remote doctors. It enables them to gather high quality clinical history and conduct clinically-relevant physical exams. Swiftsense can be used by hospitals, community health programs & governments to expand the reach of health services to ensure that vital primary care reaches remote and rural populations.
