# Contributing to Intelehealth
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue or
email with the owners of this repository before making a change.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. To add new features to make contributions to the code base, [open a new issue]() on Github
2. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`. Name the branch with your issue number (very important!).
3. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
4. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
5. Ensure the test suite passes.
6. Make sure your code lints.
7. Issue that pull request to the develop branch!
8. When a new release is planned, we'll merge the develop branch into master and compile for release.

## Any contributions you make will be under the MPL 2.0 Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same license that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report. Here's [another example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408).
Add a "bug" label to the issue. Assign a priority level (high, medium low) to share how important this bug is using labels. A high priority bug is something that affects many users and prevents them from
doing their tasks. Assign an urgency level (high, medium, low) using labels to share how quickly this bug should be fixed.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. [My stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) includes sample code that *anyone* with a base R setup can run to reproduce what I was seeing
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

We *love* thorough bug reports.

## New Feature Requests
Write a new feature request from the point of view of a user need. For example "User needs a [simpler, more effective] way to do [task]". Make sure to cover the following - WHO is the user, WHAT does
this user need to do or want to do that they cannot currently do, WHEN or under what situations do they do this, WHERE or what is the use environment, WHY is this important. If possible, briefly describe a
relevant use case or use cases. The more detail you provide the better it is!

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
Borrowing these from [Facebook's Guidelines](https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/blob/a9316a723f9e918afde44dea68b5f9f39b7d9b00/CONTRIBUTING.md)

* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* You can try running `npm run lint` for style unification
